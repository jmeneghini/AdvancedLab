\par When using a Geiger-$M\ddot{u}ller$ tube to measure radioactivity, there is a dead-time period after the tube detects an event during which no new events can be detected. We will attempt to measure this dead-time with by using the two source method. In addition to dead-time, we will also be measuring the attenuation of gamma radiation through lead. We will then compare our shielding coefficient to the known value in the scientific literature.

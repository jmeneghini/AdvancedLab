We have presented the operating voltage and dead time for our Geiger M$\ddot{u}$ller tubes, as well as the shielding coefficient for lead with gamma sources. More specifically, we presented the operating voltage as $900$ Volts and the dead time as $0.0942 \pm 0.02$ seconds. We used two sources (Co-60 \& Cs-137) and several methods to calculate the attenuation coefficient of lead shielding for gamma rays. Firstly, we calculated the attenuation coefficient for Co-60 as $8.63 \pm 10$ mm by taking the mean of the shielded data (attenuation data reference) and plugging it into our equation (attenuation equation reference). Secondly, we calculated the attenuation coefficient for Cs-137 as $9.72 \pm 0.6$ mm by fitting the data (attenuation data and plot reference). Lastly, we calculated the theoretical attenuation coefficient for Cs-137 as $14.994$ mm by the equation (theoretical attenuation equation reference). Hi John
\\ \\
Operating voltage = 900 V \\
Dead time = $0.0942 \pm 0.02$ seconds
Reported Background Count Rate  = $0.424 \pm 0.02$ counts per second \\ 
Mean attenuation coefficient for Co-60: $8.63 \pm 10$ mm (calculated by taking the mean of the shielded data) \\
Attenuation coefficient for Cs-137: $9.72 \pm 0.6$ mm (calculated by fitting the data) \\
Theoretical attenuation coefficient foor Cs-137: $14.994$ (with our Co-60 source reported to emit between 1.17 MeV and 1.333 MeV, the average between the two was taken and used to calculate the theoretical attenuation coefficient. This mass-attenuation value is 1.25 MeV mm

We have presented the operating voltage and dead time for our Geiger M$\ddot{u}$ller tubes, as well as the shielding coefficient for lead with gamma sources. More specifically, we presented the operating voltage as $900$ Volts and the dead time as $0.0942 \pm 0.02$ seconds. We have presented our results of the attenuation coefficient for Cs-137 as $11.387 \pm 0.8$ mm. This result was obtained by fitting the data on a Count Rate vs. Thickness for Lead-Shielded Cs-137. Looking at the range of radiation energy emitted by our source, between $1.17$ and $1.333$ MeV, we chose to use a theoretical calculation of the attenuation coefficient for lead from the NIST website. The attenuation coefficient of lead from a radiation source which emits $1.25$ MeV of energy is reported as $14.994$ mm. Comparing the result we obtained through data collection and analysis with the reported value from NIST, it shows that these values are not statistically similar with the theoretical value more than one standard deviation larger than the value we found through analysis.

Uncertainty and error propagation
In our analysis of the data, we subtracted the background count rate from the count rate we obtained for Cs-137

Some limitations in our research include a very high uncertainty for the average count rate of Co-60.

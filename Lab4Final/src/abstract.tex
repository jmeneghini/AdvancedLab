Modern medical imaging using x-rays pose many challenges to doctors concerning risk of cancer and damage to DNA. By creating a computational model for these x-rays using ray-tracing, the imaging process can be optimized to reduce these health risks. In this study, a monoenergetic effective energy value for an x-ray spectra was studied for varying materials using the NIST attenuation coefficients for future use in a ray-tracing model. Studied metal samples followed expected trends, and the water and plastic samples demonstrated anomalous data.

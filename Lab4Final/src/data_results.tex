In order to relate the calculated attenuation coefficient of a particular object to the effective energy, a $2^\text{nd}$ degree, 4 knot B-spline was used to fit NIST's mass attenuation coefficient data, where the mass attenuation coefficient is defined as the attenuation coefficient divided by the object's density, $\mu/\rho$. This fit, implemented with the Python package Scikit-Learn \cite{scikit-learn}, provided $\mu = f(E_{\text{eff}})$; however, $E_{\text{eff}} = f(\mu)$ was needed. The descibed fits are shown in figure \ref{figure:NISTSplineFit}.

\newpage
Because $f$ represents an abstract model, an inverse was unable to be taken, so an evenly spaced $E_{\text{eff}}$ array of 10,000 values ranging from 0.8 keV to 100 keV was substituted into our model, providing their associated $\mu/\rho$ array. Given a particular $\mu/\rho \pm \sigma$, where $\sigma$ represents the sample standard deviation of the mass attenuation coefficient, the $E_{\text{eff}}$ was found by first determining the index of the element in the $\mu/\rho$ array closest to the particular $\mu/\rho$. The associated $E_{\text{eff}}$ was then simply the element in the $E_{\text{eff}}$ array located at the determined index. The range of error for a particular $E_{\text{eff}}$ was calculated by repeating the indexing process for $\mu/\rho + \sigma$ and $\mu/\rho - \sigma$. The results of this indexing technique for each X-ray image can be in table 1-4

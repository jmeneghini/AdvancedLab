@report{Seibert,
   abstract = {The purpose is to review in a 4-part series: (i) the basic principles of x-ray production, (ii) x-ray interactions and data capture/conversion, (iii) acquisition/creation of the CT image , and (iv) operational details of a modern multislice CT scanner integrated with a PET scanner. Advances in PET technology have lead to widespread applications in diagnostic imaging and oncologic staging of disease. Combined PET/CT scanners provide the high-resolution anatomic imaging capability of CT with the metabolic and physiologic information by PET, to offer a significant increase in information content useful for the diagnostician and radiation oncologist, neurosurgeon, or other physician needing both anatomic detail and knowledge of disease extent. Nuclear medicine technologists at the forefront of PET should therefore have a good understanding of x-ray imaging physics and basic CT scanner operation, as covered by this 4-part series. After reading the first article on x-ray production, the nuclear medicine technologist will be familiar with (a) the physical characteristics of x-rays relative to other electromagnetic radiations, including-rays in terms of energy, wavelength, and frequency; (b) methods of x-ray production and the characteristics of the output x-ray spectrum; (c) components necessary to produce x-rays, including the x-ray tube/x-ray generator and the parameters that control x-ray quality (energy) and quantity; (d) x-ray production limitations caused by heating and the impact on image acquisition and clinical throughput; and (e) a glossary of terms to assist in the understanding of this information. Nucl ear medicine imaging has been an integral component of the diagnostic radiology armamentarium for several decades and is undergoing a renaissance of importance as the world of molecular imaging and genomics becomes the current research topic of interest. As those involved in nuclear diagnostic medicine have always known, the nature of nuclear medicine has been and will continue to be molecular and provide metabolic and physiologic information as well. However, a shortcoming of nuclear medicine procedures is a lack of spatial resolution and anatomic detail, in which x-ray projection imaging, CT, and MRI excel. To get the best of structural and functional imaging requires dual-modality imaging, which allows accurate registration of anatomy and physiology, the ability to visualize biologic differences between diseased and normal tissues, and quan-tification of the functional status of organs and tissues. This is particularly relevant for oncologic diagnosis and staging, therapy planning, and outcomes assessment. Not surprisingly , tremendous interest in dual-modality imaging, particularly with respect to combined PET and CT, has resulted in the implementation and adoption of dedicated PET/CT and SPECT/CT imagers in clinics throughout the nation, not only in diagnostic radiology but also in oncology and nuclear medicine (1). For the nuclear medicine technologist, therefore, added expectations, responsibilities, education requirements , and opportunities will be part of an expanding future for those involved and willing to participate in dual-modality imaging. A basic understanding of x-ray imaging physics is important for the nuclear medicine technologist; the goal of this series of papers is to provide this information. This article reviews the topic of x-ray production and control of the x-ray beam quality and quantity through the use of x-ray tubes, x-ray generators, and beam-shaping devices. Part 2 of this series investigates the characteristics of x-ray interactions, the formation of the projection image, image contrast, signal-to-noise ratio, and radiation dose. Part 3 explores the CT scanner design; acquisition and reconstruction of the projection data into a tomographic slice; characteristics of the CT image in terms of resolution,},

@article{SpekPy,
   abstract = {Purpose: SpekPy is a free toolkit for modeling x-ray tube spectra with the Python programming language. In this article, the advances in version 2.0 (v2) of the software are described, including additional target materials and more accurate modeling of the heel effect. Use of the toolkit is also demonstrated. Methods: The predictions of SpekPy are illustrated in comparison to experimentally determined spectra: three radiation quality reference (RQR) series tungsten spectra and one mammography spectrum with a molybdenum target. The capability of the software to correctly model changes in tube output with tube potential is also assessed, using the example of a GE RevolutionTM CT scanner (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA) and specifications in the system's Technical Reference Manual. Furthermore, we note that there are several physics models available in SpekPy. These are compared on and off the central axis, to illustrate the differences. Results: SpekPy agrees closely with the experimental spectra over a wide range of tube potentials, both visually and in terms of first and second half-value layers (HVLs) (within 2% here). The CT scanner spectrum output (normalized to 120 kV tube potential) agreed within 4% over the range of 70 to 140 kV. The default physics model (casim) is adequate in most situations. The advanced option (kqp) should be used if high accuracy is desired for modeling the anode heel effect, as it fully includes the effects of bremsstrahlung anisotropy. Conclusions: SpekPy v2 can reliably predict on- and off-axis spectra for tungsten and molybdenum targets. SpekPy's open-source MIT license allows users the freedom to incorporate this powerful toolkit into their own projects.},

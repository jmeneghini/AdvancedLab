\par In this experiment, we attempted to measure the natural resonance frequencies of various systems of forced, damped harmonic oscillators and compare these measured values to theoretical values. To do this, we need to use the equation for forced, damped harmonic oscillation and solve for the natural resonance frequency. The force being applied to our system is
\begin{equation}
\textbf{F}_{driving} = F_0 cos(\omega t + \phi)

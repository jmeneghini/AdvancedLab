To determine the spring constant of the springs used in the harmonic oscillator system, each spring was connected to a metal stand and mass was added to the end of the spring, increasing the spring's displacement from equilibrium. This displacement was measured with a meter stick while increasing the attached mass from 50 g to 130 g in steps of 20 g. The associated spring constant was then determined by plotting the gravitational force of the mass against the displacement of the spring, and then fitting the data, located in Table \ref{tab::springTable}, using a linear fit. This process was repeated for each of the three springs.

Each displacement was measured using a meter stick with an uncertainty of 0.05 cm. The mass was given by the labelling on the mass and the gravitational force was calculated using the mass and the acceleration due to gravity.}

With the R$^2$ of each fit being 1.00 and each value having a low uncertainty, these values were deemed to be both accurate and precise. Furthermore, due to the similarity of the three spring constants, the average of the three, $k = 3.51 \pm 0.02$ N/m (assuming Gaussian) was used for the harmonic oscillator calculations.

For the single air cart, forced, damped harmonic oscillator, the measured oscillation amplitude was plotted against the set driving frequency of the motor.

With the resonance frequencies of a harmonic oscillator being the particular frequencies that result in a local oscillation amplitude maximum, the single resonance frequency of the single mass system was $0.920 \pm 0.0005$ Hz, due to it resulting in a maximum oscillation amplitude of $11.5 \pm 0.05$ cm. With the theoretical resonance frequency of the system being $0.926 \pm 0.002$ Hz, the experimental and theoretical values are not statistically equivalent; however, they are within three standard deviations of each other.

Using the same method from the previous system, a resonance frequency of $0.869 \pm 0.0005$ Hz was obtained experimentally for the increased mass air cart. With the theoretical resonance frequency of the system being $0.884 \pm 0.002$ Hz, the experimental and theoretical values are not statistically equivalent.

For the double air cart system, as expected, we observed two resonance frequencies, represented by the two local maxima. In particular, the experimental \textit{slow} and \textit{fast} resonance frequencies were $0.649 \pm 0.0005$ Hz and $1.130 \pm 0.0005$ Hz, respectively. With the theoretical \textit{slow} and \textit{fast} resonance frequencies being $0.655 \pm 0.002$ Hz and $1.134 \pm 0.003$ Hz, respectively, neither of our experimental values were statistically equivalent to their theoretical expectations.
